# Deploy wordpress into ECS Fargate with Terraform
The idea behind this project came from the need to build a simple Wordpress application in just few simple steps without the need to manage how much capacity in term of computation I needed.

At that time I was already familiar with AWS, but maninly with EC2 instances and never had the chance to work on microservices. So I sayd to myself.....hey why don't you build a simple website by using ECS? 

I started doing my researches and came up with a very interesting article from AWS that explained how to deploy a Wordpress application in ECS, so I said: here we are! job done!
The only "issue" I saw with it, was that the project was built with Cloudformation, but I wanted it to be done in Terraform.
